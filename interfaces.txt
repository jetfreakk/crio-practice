A way to achieve abstraction
Define the contract for the subclass to Implementation
public static and final (attribute)
methods are abstract and public
CANNOT INSTANTIATE
100% abstraction 
Abstract classes can have method implementations but interfaces can't
Can extend interface 
If a class implements interfaces, it must provde implementation for all of its method
Unless it is an abstract class
